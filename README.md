# Content
The files include python implementation of some algorithms and data structures:
- *find_union_tree.py* includes tree implementation of find-union sets. The structure is described in [1];
- *eratosthenes_sieve.py* contains prime number generator which uses [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes);
- *list_based_dict.py* implements a dictionary that stores a list of key-value pairs and mimics the interface of the built-in `dict` type,
- *diff.py* is a file comparison program based on a generalized algorithm finding the [longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence),
- *hanoi_tower.py* solves [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) (using a recursive algorithm) and visualizes the solution (using [pyglet](https://pyglet.org/)),
- *word2word.py* solves [Doublets (A Word Puzzle By Lewis Carroll)](https://lewiscarrollresources.net/doublets/index.html) using [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search),
- *sort_complexity.py* - sorting by swapping with minimum and merge sort with time complexity plots + binary search,
- *newton.py* - various methods for calculating [binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient),
- *segment_tree_point_range_sum.py* and *segment_tree_point_range_sum_customizable.py* - [Segment Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree) with single value updates and range queries
- *centroid_decomposition.py* - centroid decomposition of the tree to calculate the shortest path in the logarithmic time
