The files include python implementation of some algorithms and data structures:
- *find_union_tree.py* includes tree implementation of find-union sets. The structure is described in [1];
- *eratosthenes_sieve.py* contains prime number generator which uses [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes);
- *list_based_dict.py* implements a dictionary that stores a list of key-value pairs and mimics the interface of the built-in `dict` type.
